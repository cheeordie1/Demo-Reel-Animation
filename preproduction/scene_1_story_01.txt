A Block that reads Nick's Demo Reel will sit in the background, and a pixy will fly onto screen.

Chasing the pixy, a young Koromon will also run onto screen. The pixy and the koromon will play
around, and the pixy will outsmart the koromon.

The koromon will get flustered and digivolve into Agumon and start shooting fire at the nimbly
dodging pixy. The fire will explode on te demo reel letters and ignite some of them.

Then, headon will appear and put Agumon in a bubble. The pixy will sit on the bubble triumphantly.
Headon will carry the bubble offscreen. The letters will collapse.
